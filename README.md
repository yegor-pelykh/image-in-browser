# image-in-browser

## Description

Package for converting images between different formats that works in the browser (no need for server Node.js).

It may be necessary when you need to work with static or animated images directly in the browser code, when the code is isolated from the system it is running on.

It is able to decode static and animated images from the buffer (byte data) into a special raw MemoryImage object, as well as encode this MemoryImage object vice-versa into the buffer, which is essentially the contents of the image file.

The following formats are currently supported for encoding/decoding:
- BMP,
- GIF,
- ICO,
- JPEG,
- PNG

Fully compatible with the ES6 standard and provides typings for use with Typescript.
